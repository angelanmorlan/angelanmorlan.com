My name is Angela Morlan. I am about to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Visual Communication Design from Eastern Washington University in Cheney, Washington. I have learned so much in my three year study. I also dived into the world of programming with a minor in computer application development, which has been quite interesting, but very intense at times. I am excited what awaits me for my career in design.
